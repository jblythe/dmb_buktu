The Fellas believe that food is an important pillar in bringing communities, young and old together, and our barbecue does just that.', 'For years, a common criticism of all food trucks have been the same thing: wait times.  Food trucks are known for having terrible service times for all types of food.  Customers have to wait 30 plus minutes sometime just for a simple order of tacos.

The Fellas pride ourselves on serving fresh, quality barbecue from our food truck with a wait time less than 90 seconds for all orders.', 'The Fellas Chicken and Ribs takes pride in owning our own food truck.  Because of this, we value small business ownership.  During our events, The Fellas partner with a local vendor (whether it be a DJ, event planner, or another food truck), in order to allow that business to be apart of the event.  We also allow other food caterers to rent out our food truck in order for them to service their events.', 'The Fellas Chicken and Ribs is the future of not only the barbecue food industry, but also the food industry.  Since Covid, brick and mortar restaurant purchases have taken a nosedive due to the average consumer moving away from traditional dine-in restaurants.
